# TaskManagement_SpringBootMongoDB

- This project is maninly a small version of Jira which basically logs in the Employee in it.
- The user is authenticated, and then the logged in user can add tasks.
- Tasks have a status, title and description.
- Task is deleted once the user is deleted. So each task is related to the employee who creates it.

Details on the tools that are used:
- I have used MongoDB for the database which stores the employee information and the task information.
- Spring Framework is used. Spring boot starter is used to start the project and the dependies are also added using the spring boot starter.
- Postman is used to check the endpoints.
